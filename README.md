# Blog built with Next.js

---

This blog is inspired by [timlrx's tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). While the original project is an excellent starting point, I wanted to build a blog that allows for blog posts to be uploaded directly through the website, instead of managing posts via Git, which felt a bit too complex for my needs.

To achieve this, I decided to move away from using the content-layer component and instead built an admin backend to manage blog posts.

## Project Highlights:
- Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS: Leveraging the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
- Custom Blog Management System: Instead of adding posts manually through Git, this project includes a simple and intuitive backend for uploading and managing blog content.
- First Project with React and Next.js: This is my first experience writing frontend code with React and Next.js, so the code might not be perfect. But Iâ€™m committed to improving it over time.
## Goals:
- Continuous Improvement: While the project may not be perfect, I aim to improve it to the best of my ability. I welcome suggestions and contributions from others.
- Sharing Knowledge: My hope is that this project can be a useful resource for others planning to build a blog website, especially those looking for a simple and user-friendly backend to manage their posts.
- Feel free to explore the project, **suggest improvements, or help me correct any mistakes in the code**. It would be a great honor!
